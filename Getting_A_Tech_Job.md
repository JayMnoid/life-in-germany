## Shortest path to getting jobs? ü§î

I feel the shortest path to get a job in Germany as a foreigner is having two to three years of career in a high demand high supply tech stack then moving to Germany. Getting a job in a foreign country is always a risk, and you might end up wasting time due to many reasons.

I've seen some people trying to get a job with no career in tech, entering Germany with a high risk. It is still possible to find a job but I feel this is too much high of a risk to take, because usually the biggest obstacle of getting a tech job is not having a career or a tech background to begin with, so you never know how long it'll take to get a job. 

If you have no plans to study, I recommend you to try to get a tech job in your own country and work for two to three years, and then moving to Germany. I feel this is the lower risk while you can still can get some working experience without having the risk of getting kicked out of the country.

## Platform to look for jobs ‚ÑπÔ∏èü§î

Here are the common platforms to look for tech jobs, and in my experience, if you're looking for an English speaking job, you'll most likely finding them on linkedin. 

- [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com)
- [xing.com](https://www.xing.com)
- [stepstone.de](https://www.stepstone.de)
- [honeypot.io](https://www.honeypot.io)
- [talent.io](https://www.talent.io)
- [berlinstartupjobs](https://berlinstartupjobs.com/de/)

I've tried honeypot, which is similar to talent.io, is a platform where active head-hunters will try to match companies with candidates. The people here speak English so it shouldn't be a problem. I hadn't a great expreince with them maybe because I have a skillset which is neither with high demand nor with high supply, so I felt they didn't really understood my past experience and I hadn't feel like my resume was respected. But I think if you'd work in web development (full stack, frontend, backend) it might work out for you.

Xing is a German jobs oriented platform, if you want to look for Germany speaking tech jobs, this is the place to go. Stepstone is similar in that sense, but it contains both German and English jobs. 

Big companies sometimes do not offer jobs in these platforms, so you might want to go in their individual career site to apply for jobs.

But in my experience, many of the English jobs are reposted in many different platforms, so using one - for me linkedin - many of the time made sense.

## Looking for salary information ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Here are some websites that you can look for salary information

- [glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com)
- [payscale.com](https://www.payscale.com/en-eu/)
- [levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi)
- [Yearly salary reports from talent.io](https://join.talent.io/tech-salary-report-en)

But I think the easiest way is to google for "'company name' + 'title' + 'germany' + 'Salary'" (e.g. "SAP Senior Software Engineer Germany Salary")
