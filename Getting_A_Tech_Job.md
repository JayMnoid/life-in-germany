## Platform to look for jobs ‚ÑπÔ∏è

Here are the common platforms to look for tech jobs, and in my experience, if you're looking for an English speaking job, you'll most likely finding them on linkedin. 

- [linkedin.com](https://www.linkedin.com)
- [xing.com](https://www.xing.com)
- [stepstone.de](https://www.stepstone.de)
- [honeypot.io](https://www.honeypot.io)
- [talent.io](https://www.talent.io)
- [berlinstartupjobs](https://berlinstartupjobs.com/de/)

I've tried honeypot, which is similar to talent.io, is a platform where active head-hunters will try to match companies with candidates. The people here speak English so it shouldn't be a problem. I hadn't a great expreince with them maybe because I have a skillset which is neither with high demand nor with high supply, so I felt they didn't really understood my past experience and I hadn't feel like my resume was respected. But I think if you'd work in web development (full stack, frontend, backend) it might work out for you.

Xing is a German jobs oriented platform, if you want to look for Germany speaking tech jobs, this is the place to go. Stepstone is similar in that sense, but it contains both German and English jobs. 

Big companies sometimes do not offer jobs in these platforms, so you might want to go in their individual career site to apply for jobs.
