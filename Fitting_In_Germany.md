# How do I know if I fit well in Germany? :thinking:

All of the following sections are discussing about something about a subjective matter. Although I'm trying to be genuine on what I write down, everyone's experience is unique and my reference point is what I had exprienced in South Korea, thus cannot represent what everyone would feel when you arrive, as you would feel different for everything, and the matter only is how different your experience or feeling should be. So please try to take what I wrote down here with a grain of salt here. 

Also, per my experience, many people who lived in their own countries for most of their lives tend not to understand the difference between cultures and systems before they actually experienced it, so fantasizing the life in other countries doesn't help that much when deciding a new place to live. Please keep in mind that everything and everywhere has its pros and cons, and something that I love could be something that you hate the most.
