# Arriving Germany

There is an exact sequence of steps that you need to take before you can do anything in Germany.

## Entering Germany ℹ️

Depending on whether you're eligible for 90 days of Schengen Visa or not, you'll need to get a visa to enter Germany. Every country is different in this matter, so I'll not cover how you'd get a permit to enter Germany.

## Getting an apartment to live in ℹ️

I've split this into another document, you can read about this in [Housing](https://github.com/h-joo/life-in-germany/blob/main/Housing.md)

## Register at your City ( Wohnungsanmeldung ) ℹ️

Once you have a rental contract you now can finally register to a city. You can search for "Wohnungsanmeldung 'name of your city'" in google to find a website which you can learn about the whereabouts of the offices (Bürgeramt) and how you can get an appointment. In bigger cities, the appointment is almost always fully booked out for the upcoming weeks, so it's good to act faster and book an appointment much before you even move into your apartment. You usually need to register within (Citation needed) 2 weeks after you move into an apartment, and you can get fined otherwise.

Many of the workers in these offices usually don't speak English, so if you want to avoid the hassle, bring somebody who can help you out through the process.

Documents that you need bring is usually

1. Copy of your rental contract
1. Wohnraumbescheinigung
1. Your Passport

The Wohnraumbescheinigung is a confirmation from the landlord saying that indeed you're the tenant of the written address. You can find the form usually by Googling "Wohnraumbescheinigung 'city name' formular". Upon registration in the office, you will be given the confirmation document "Anmeldungsbestätigung" of which you should always keep and maybe even want to store it in a digital form, as you will need this for VISA application and also for keeping the date of move in Germany. (Some VISA application form requires you to write the exact date you move in within Germany)

## Opening a bank Account ℹ️

For non-online banks, you are required to have an registered address and thus a "Anmeldungsbestätigung" to be able to create a bank account. For online banks it's usually not required, but they might not accept your passport depending on where you come from, or whether your passport is a bit old (e.g. when countries change their shape of the passport and thus have a new "shape").

The following two banks are well known online banks, I will not discuss the individual benefits of different banks as they're subject to change.

- N26
- Vivid

There are also many big non-online banks such as 

- Commerzbank
- Deutschbank
- Postbank
- Sparkasse
- Volksbank
- ... and many other banks

I hear from many different people, but I feel people have their reasons for their dislike and like some banks, so I won't be recommending one bank, but one thing to note that is Sparkasse is a local bank, meaning that you cannot withdraw money from a different regional Sparkasse. 

It is usually possible in a bigger branches of these banks to find a person who speaks English, so the language usually isn't a problem. The number of branches in your town might also help decide which bank you want to open an account for if you want to withdraw money regulalrly, as I think it has been a bit rarer nowadays, but even just a couple years ago, there were some restaurants and shops that wouldn't accept debit or credit cards so you were forced to use cash sometimes.

## Get a health insurance ℹ️

Although I feel the health system in Germany is a bit slow (i.e. difficult to get an appointment and even though you do, you need to wait a lot for treatment), the coverage is usually good. So I feel it's usually a better option to go for public health insurance (Gesetzliche Krankenversicherung) if you're working and not earning too much. 

For students you can be ensured by some private health insurance which are really cheap, but they have less coverages and the process of getting your money back is sometimes a pain. I would suggest rather not get into cheap private health insurances if you can offord the public ones. 
 
People who earn lots of money I heard leave the public insurance for several reasons, sometimes there are doctors who has much less waiting time for the bit expensive private insurances, but since the amount of money you pay for public health insurance is proportional to your salary, you might actually pay less for these private health insurances.

I've never tried leaving the public health inusrance so I am not the best one to talk about this topic, so if you need to decided in between private or public I think you should be researching for yourself, but if you're just a regular software engineer don't think much about it and get a public one. I heard from many tech people choose TK, there are several options for public insurances (AOK, Bamer, TK, ...)

## Getting a residence permit ℹ️

If you've done all the previous steps, you're finally reached the bare minimum for applying for a residence permit. There are many different type of permit, but I'm going to only list few that I think are relevant.

- [Language Learning VISA](https://www.germany-visa.org/student-visa/language-course/)
- [Student VISA](https://www.germany-visa.org/student-visa/)
- [Job Seeking VISA](https://www.germany-visa.org/job-seeker-visa/)
- [Job seeking VISA for German University Graduates](https://stadt.muenchen.de/service/info/hauptabteilung-ii-buergerangelegenheiten-auslaenderangelegenheiten/10260824/)
- [Employment VISA](https://www.germany-visa.org/work-employment-visa/)
- [Blue Card](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/de/visum-aufenthalt/arten/blaue-karte-eu)

I've linked English sites to help understand the readers, but you SHOULD verify with the official German version for all in case anything has changed and thus might not be accurate. If you want to be a student you'll most likely follow the track of getting 

- Language Learning -> Student -> Job Seeking for German Graduates -> Blue Card / Employment 

If you already have a career, you'll most likely follow the track of 

- Job Seeking -> Blue Card / Employment 

if you're trying to look a job while being present in Germany. 

Each of the link has whole information and what you need to apply, and it should be pretty straightforward, but one thing to note between the difference of job seeking for Germany university graudates and non-graduates is that you can actually work with the Job seeking visa if you have graduated from Germany, and it can be extended upto 18 months. 

And maybe also one more thing to note, Germany is short on skilled workers and thus has a low migration hurdle due to the presence of Blue Card. If you are qualified for Blue Card and a working contract, your company doesn't have to do anything to convince or justify the immigration office or the labor office that they need you. 

One hurdle that might get in the way is whether your university is recognized by the Geman govermant or your subject of study aligns to what the immigrant office expects - if you studied a hybrid topic such as Bio Information theory, it might not be fully accepted by the offices so you need to fight for it and need to justify or maybe need a lawyer to get through the process, but this happens rarely.
