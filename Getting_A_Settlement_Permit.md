# Getting a Settlement Permit (Niederlassungserlaubnis) ℹ️

> **Note**
> Getting a settlement permit takes from 21 months to maximum 60 months of your contribution to the German pension (Deutsch Rentenversicherung) depending on your situation, and by that time you wouldn't actually need any guide to help you. But this document is intended for expats who are planning ahead and trying to learn their options in advance. On a similar sense, the difference between a German citizen and a person with Niederlassungserlaubnis isn't that much different except for voting rights. And I'm not going to cover how to get naturalized, as you'd already know well by the time you aim for it, and it's a bit too far away to plan in 7 years in my opinion.

As a software engineer or someone with a tech job, there can be several ways that you can get a permernent residency. Here's an official page of which  you can read in detail in [German](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/de/visum-aufenthalt/dauerhaft-in-deutschland/niederlassungserlaubnis) and in [English](https://www.make-it-in-germany.com/en/visa-residence/living-permanently/settlement-permit) of the requirements. This doc is just a summary of them :)

1. Blue Card + A1 German Level + 21 months of pension contribution.
1. Blue Card + B1 German Level + 33 months of pension contribution.
1. German Degree or a Vocational training (Berufsausbildung) + 24 months of pension contribution after graduation which the job is related to the study.
1. Without Blue Card and without a German Degree + 60 months of pension contribution.
1. (Not going to discuss further) Been married to a German citizen for X years.

Recently, the authorities started the applicants to take the test [Life in Germany](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einb%C3%BCrgerungstest), which wasn't mandatory before, but as I have experienced, the test itself is easy to prepare as it's just a set of questions being asked in a bigger pool of known questions. 

Besides that, I don't think it's worth to have a comprehensive list of the required documents because it depends on the type of application and might also depend on the state, and it is subject to change, but here are some examples from the [Bayern state](https://www.eap.bayern.de/informationen/leistungsbeschreibung/769754656498) web-page : 

- Valid passport
- Current biometric photo (frontal photo)
- Proof of a secure livelihood
- Proof of sufficient living space
- Proof of health insurance cover
- etc ...

There's a [pending bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/germany/comments/127jskh/government_draft_law_for_immigration_reform_i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) which makes this shorter and allowing more working hours for people with different residence permits, I'll update this page once the bill is in place.

So there are multiple path of getting a settlement permit which can vary from 21 months to 60 months. Germany is currently short of skilled workers, thus being very aggresive and making it very easy to attract people to come to Germany, but yet - there's a hurdle for foreigners of which Germany is not an English speaking country which makes people to hesitate, but is also a good place if you're willing to migrate despite that fact.


## Benefits ℹ️

The greatest benefit is of-course you will not be kicked out of Germany even you are unemployed for a longer period. You can get full unemploymenet (ALG I) benefits for a year, compared to other peoples who are bound to their residence permit for 3 to 6 months 

## Post-requirements to maintain the settlement permit ℹ️

You need to stay and registered in Germany for 6 months per year or get a special permission to avoid this requirement, otherwise it will be invalidated [\[1\]](https://www.berlin.de/einwanderung/aufenthalt/erloeschen-von-aufenthaltstiteln/) [\[2\]](https://12anwalt.de/rechtsgebiete/auslaenderrecht/niederlassungserlaubnis/).
